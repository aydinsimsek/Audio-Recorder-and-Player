# About
This is an ARM Cortex-M4 based embedded systems project for capturing audio data via MAX9814 microphone module and playing it through a speaker by varying the output frequency between 2 kHz to 10 kHz to create vocal effects on the recording. 

MCP 4725 DAC module is operated using I2C Serial Communication Protocol. 

Push buttons on the TM4C123 microcontroller is used for initiating recording and playing. 

RGB LEDs indicate the operation status.
