# About
This is an ARM Cortex-M4 based embedded systems project for capturing audio data via MAX9814 microphone module and playing it through a speaker by varying the output frequency between 2 kHz to 10 kHz to create vocal effects on the recording. 

Push buttons on the TM4C123 microcontroller is used to initiate recording and playing. 

RGB LEDs indicate the operation status.
